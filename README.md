Schildergenerator
=================

A web service to quickly create and print signs using a common design.
Especially useful for events.

You might find it useful in the following scenarios:
  
  * You need to set up an event where visitors need signs to point them around.
  * You often need to change some signs in your organization.
  * You're bored in the Fachschaftsbüro.

What you need for this tool to unleash it's maximum potential:

  * A printer on premise.
  * Some kind of server, preferrably running a flavor of Linux, capable of printing
    on said printer via lpd interface. A RaspberryPi would suffice, even if it's slow.
  * Web clients of any type being able to connect to said server.
  * The knowledge to modify a LaTeX template to fit your organizations design.

After you put in the initial work of setting this up, you'll have a service 
where everyone on your team can quickly create a new sign as soon as they see a
need for it (provided they've got a mobile web client) just by typing a headline
and some text, selecting or uploading an image -- and by the time they arrive at
the printer, the sign is already printed and ready to be posted on the wall. All
while heeding the event's design.

> This script frees the event organisators of the responsibility to pre-think
> all the details of sign-making. Instead, this part can simply be delegated to 
> the helpers who are setting up the event by showing them the web frontend of
> this tool.


Dependencies
------------

  * python-flask, python-genshi 
  * python-pythonmagick, graphicsmagick
  * pdflatex, latex-beamer, texlive-latex-extra, lexlive-lang-german
  * cups, cups-bsd 
  * some pypi-packages: requirements.txt 
  * libapache2-mod-wsgi for production use 
    (or [anything capable of running WSGI apps](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/servers.html) really…)
  or
  * docker.io, docker-compose

Download
--------

       $ git clone https://github.com/kif-ev/schildergenerator.git


Config
------
### Normal installation

  * *for testing and production use using wsgi*: copy config.py.example to config.py and edit it to your needs.
  * *for production use using wsgi*: copy schildergen.wsgi.example to schildergen.wsgi and edit it.
  
### With Docker

- Copy config.py.example to config.py and edit it.
  - Set the `app_secret`
  - Set the `basedir` to /app
  - You may have to change the listen-address at the bottom
- Select the latex packages you want to install in the Dockerfile

Modify the templates
--------------------

A suitable test workflow might be recreating the same sign in
the webinterface while always saving under the same name.

After you're done with modifying the template, you might want to run

	$ python schilder.py --recreate-cache

to delete all cached pdf and image thumbnails, then re-run pdflatex on all 
saved signs. Accessing the webinterface will recreate the rest of the cached 
image thumbnails.


Running in test/debug mode
--------------------------

You need to have the config done. Then you could just start the server in debug mode:

       $ python schilder.py

This will serve a webpage at http://localhost:5432/ for testing purposes.
